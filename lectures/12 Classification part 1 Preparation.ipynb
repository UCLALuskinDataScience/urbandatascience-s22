    "## Lecture objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce the principles of machine learning\n",
    "2. More practice with data wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a very general term that covers many parts of data science. Here, we will look at two specific problems that machine learning is well equipped to handle:\n",
    "* Classification (this week)\n",
    "* Clustering (next week)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a broad generalization, machine learning-based classification focuses on *prediction*. For example: [which neighborhoods are likely to gentrify](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0042098018789054)? [Which facilities are likely to be violating environmental standards?](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0142-9) What is demand likely to be at a new bikeshare station? [What is the race and gender of an author on a course reading list](http://syllabusdiversity.org)?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also applications which raise more concerns with ethics and justice (yes, [predictive policing](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/17/1005396/predictive-policing-algorithms-racist-dismantled-machine-learning-bias-criminal-justice/), I'm talking about you). We'll come back to these issues in a couple of weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is less successful with questions of *causation* and *hypothesis testing*. Here, a statistical approach (frequentist or Bayesian) is likely to be more appropriate, although there is quite a bit of overlap between \"statistics\" and \"machine learning.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least three widely used approaches to classification.\n",
    "* Logistic regression. This is often used in a more statistical setting, but is the starting point for much machine learning analysis. \n",
    "* Random forests. We'll focus on this technique.\n",
    "* Neural networks. Often used for image recognition, this can be a \"black box\" approach to prediction and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: machine learning is a very large field, and there are entire courses on the theory and applications. Here, we will give a very high-level overview. We'll focus on the big-picture applicability of machine learning techniques, and actually implementing them in Python. We'll skate over the theoretical underpinnings and the details of the various algorithms."

    "## Example: ADUs in LA\n",
    "The example we will use is whether property owners construct Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) in the City of Los Angeles. You might imagine that a predictive approach could be useful to planners and policymakers. Not least, they could predict future ADU growth, and the neighborhoods where ADUs are most likely to be built.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can obtain the data from the City's building permits database (which tells us whether or not an ADU was built), and the County Assessor parcel database (which provides covariates such as lot size). Because both of these datasets are very large, I preprocessed them and saved a slimmed-down version that is in your GitHub folder. Specifically, I extracted a subset of fields, limited the building permits to those that include an ADU, and limited the parcels to those in the City of LA."
