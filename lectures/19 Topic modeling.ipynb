    "So far, we've got some text into Python from a PDF, cleaned it up, and split the string into sentences and words. We've also done simple word counts. Now, we'll see what topic modeling - one method under the broader umbrella of natural language processing - can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two examples in urban studies that use topic modeling are [Han et al.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2020.1831401) who analyze election communications, and [Brinkley & Stahmer](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0739456X21995890) who analyze General Plans. But let's say a little about the principles first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is a method to identify patterns in text documents. It's an *unsupervised* machine learning technique, i.e. it doesn't need to be \"trained\" on a dataset of known topics. Rather, it identifies topics from the ground up. \n",
    "\n",
    "In that sense, topic modeling is related to cluster analysis. However, a document can belong (partially) to multiple topics, where an observation is typically assigned to a single cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "But both cluster analysis and topic modeling perform *dimensionality reduction*. Suppose we have 1000 distinct words in a document, that we reduce to 10 topics. We are going from a 1000-dimensional space to a 10-dimensional space. Obviously, 10 dimensions are much easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several algorithms that implement topic modeling; we'll focus on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (as in the Han et al. paper). We'll use the `gensim` library, although `sklearn` is a popular alternative. `gensim` is dedicated to NLP, while `sklearn` is a more general machine-learning library.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with looking at a selection of Climate Action Plans (CAPs) from cities and counties in California. These are some of the plans I analyzed [in a project on equity in CAPS](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0739456X211072527) with Hillary Angelo, Key MacFarlane, and James Sirigotis. Thanks to these collaborators for permission to share this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plans are in a directory in your GitHub repository. We can see the list using `os`."
