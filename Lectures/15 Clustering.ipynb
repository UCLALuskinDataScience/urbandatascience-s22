    "## Why cluster?\n",
    "Cluster analysis is an exploratory technique to identify sensible groupings in a dataset. The analyst has no prior knowledge of what these clusters are, and the data are not labeled with the \"correct\" cluster. Thus, cluster analysis is an *unsupervised* machine learning technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some potential applications of clustering:\n",
    "* Identify types of Marine Protected Area (e.g., [Bohorquez et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X19304439))\n",
    "* Identify types of street networks (e.g., [Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball 2020](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/4/1941))\n",
    "* Identify types of neighborhood (e.g., [Kendig 2007](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944367608977731))\n",
    "* Identify types of transit agencies (e.g. [Ederer et al. 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0361198119852074))\n",
    "* Identify patterns of cruising ror parking (e.g. [Millard-Ball, Weinberger & Hampshire 2021](https://findingspress.org/article/28061-the-shape-of-cruising))\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering the data in this way can help you see regularities in the data that you can then interpret. It might suggest policies that are appropriate for one group of cities or agencies but not another. Or it could identify a peer group against which to benchmark (say) affordable housing construction costs or transit on-time performance."

    "Formally, clustering takes a set of *N* objects and finds *K* groups based on a measure of similarity. For a technical yet accessible overview, I recommend [Jain 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865509002323). \n",
    "\n",
    "The two broad groups of clustering algorithms are *hierarchical* and *partitional*. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's start with a partitional algorithm. The most popular is called *k-means*. Again, this is an exploratory data analysis process. The analyst needs to specify the number of clusters *K*, and should experiment with different values of *K* until a meaningful grouping emerges. Another way to choose *K* is the [elbow method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_(clustering)), but we won't discuss that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: precinct-level voting\n",
    "We'll use the `sklearn` library to implement the k-means algorithm. The aim: identify a typology of voters based on precinct-level data.\n",
